none "I haven't seen Suwako for quite awhile…"
"I mean, she has been known to get into trouble from time to time, but she's never been away for this long."
"Maybe she went off to confront that ice fairy who's been freezing the frogs?"
"Suwako may not be the goddess of the Moriya Shrine anymore, but Kanako and I still want to know what she's up to!"
sanae joyful "My name is Sanae Kochiya."
"I'm a shrine maiden of Kanako Yasaka and the distant descendant of Suwako Moriya."
sanae eyesclosed "And I guess you could say I'm kind of a god myself."
sanae surprised "A living god!"
sanae joyful "But I don't want to brag…"
sanae eyesclosed "Anyway, I need to find out where Suwako has gone!"
sanae sad "Hopefully she hasn't gotten herself into too much trouble."
sanae angry "But I know Kanako is counting on me, so I can't fail!" 
sanae joyful "Even if things go wrong, I've got the power of miracles on my side!"
sanae neutral "But where can I look for clues? I have no idea where she could be."
sanae sad "What if someone is responsible for her disappearance?"
sanae eyesclosed "No… Suwako wouldn't be so easily apprehended by someone with ill intentions."
sanae neutral "Even so, it does make me wonder if someone took her away."
sanae joyful "I guess it's time to figure that all out now!"
