sanae neutral "Hey, Reimu."
reimu neutral "Hm?"
sanae neutral "Uhm, what’cha doin’?"
reimu surprised "Ah, I’m just looking around, I guess. I don’t think I’ve ever been to this area of the forest before."
reimu neutral "But, then again, I guess it all kind of looks the same."
sanae neutral "Ah, if you look closely, I’m sure there are some differences."
reimu neutral "Well, when you’re always running around solving incidents, I guess you don’t have much time to take in the scenery."
sanae surprised "Oh, right…"
sanae neutral "Wanna take a look around? Y’know, while Cirno is ‘conserving her power.’"
reimu neutral "I guess there’s not much else to do."
"Not much to look at except some trees and bushes."
"Wait a minute, is there something in that bush?"
sanae surprised "?"
reimu surprised "There is! Did someone just leave this here?"
sanae surprised "What is it?"
reimu surprised "Did someone just dump their wallet’s contents into this bush?!"
reimu neutral "Wait, somehow I feel like Yukari could be responsible for this…"
sanae neutral "Ah, you think so?"
reimu neutral "Maybe. It could be a prank, but…"
reimu joyful "Oh, well! Finders keepers!"
sanae surprised "Are you really taking it?"
reimu joyful "Yeah, why not? It’s not like anyone else is here."
"Besides, if Yukari transported some poor fool’s money into this forest, it’s not like they would be able to find it afterwards."
sanae surprised "What if it’s your money she took?"
reimu angry "Hey! It’s not like I have much to steal anyway."
reimu neutral "Besides, if it IS mine, then I’m here to take it back now!"
sanae neutral "Uhm… I guess."
reimu neutral "Oh, you think there’s any more around?"
sanae surprised "Why would there be more?!"
reimu joyful "Hey, it doesn’t hurt to check."
sanae neutral "Fine, let’s keep looking."
