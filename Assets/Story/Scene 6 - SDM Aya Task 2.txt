reimu neutral "..."
cirno joyful "..."
reimu eyesclosed "Fine, let’s just go."

aya neutral "Now, if I were the Scarlet Devil, where would I be?"
sanae neutral "I’d assume in her mansion."
aya neutral "Well, duh! But where exactly in the mansion?"
sanae neutral "I feel like she’d be in the deepest part of the house."
"That seems all broody and vampire-ish to me."
aya neutral "Ah, well I don’t know much about vampires. I haven’t met many, but I’ll take your word for it."
sanae joyful "In the outside world, I used to watch movies with vampires all the time!"

sanae neutral "But when I saw her, I noticed she didn’t have the glittery skin and I was confused."
"Maybe that’s a harmful stereotype?"
aya surprised "Uhh, I have no idea what you’re talking about. And what’s a ‘movie?’"
sanae eyesclosed "Ah, it’s just me reminiscing about my old life in the outside world."
sanae neutral "But I really do think we should make our way towards the back of the mansion."
aya neutral "Agreed! Race you there!"

aya joyful "Okay, fine! But don’t take too long or I’ll get antsy."
