"We went outside to see Reimu and Cirno enjoying the pleasant weather together."
"Aya took me down the steps of the shrine and we went to the forested area behind the building."
"She told me that she always wanted to take more photos around the Moriya Shrine, but she thought it wasn’t worth the trouble dealing with Kanako to get them."
"I assured Aya, that as long as she was with me, she could take all of the photos she wanted."
"It felt amazing to learn something new from someone so passionate about the subject."
"Around Aya, I feel even more energetic than usual and I’m so happy to have met her, despite our past."
"Even though I don’t know what the future holds, I’m excited to see where the wind takes us."
"I’m confident that things between Aya and I will go exactly as they should, when the time is right."
